# GIF Issues Fixed - Summary Report

## ðŸŽ¯ Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Web Interface Path Issue**
**Problem:** The JavaScript code was trying to load GIFs from `SpeechToSign/${gifFile}` path, but since the HTML file is inside the SpeechToSign directory, this created an incorrect nested path.

**Fix:** Updated `script.js` to use the correct relative path `${gifFile}` instead of `SpeechToSign/${gifFile}`.

**Files Modified:**
- `SpeechToSign/script.js` - Fixed GIF path references

### 2. **Error Handling Enhancement**
**Problem:** No proper error handling when GIF files fail to load in the web interface.

**Fix:** Added comprehensive error handling with:
- `onerror` event handler for images
- Visual error messages when GIFs fail to load
- Console logging for successful GIF loads
- Fallback error display with helpful messages

### 3. **Python Application Verification**
**Status:** âœ… **Already Working Correctly**
- The Python application (`signlanguage_fixed.py`) was already working properly
- GIF loading and display functionality is intact
- All required dependencies are available

## ðŸ§ª Testing Results

```

## ðŸš€ How to Use the Application

### Option 1: Python Desktop Application (Recommended)
```bash
cd SpeechToSign
python signlanguage_fixed.py
```

**Features:**
- Real-time speech recognition
- High-quality GIF playback in OpenCV windows
- Support for all 6 sign language phrases
- Fallback to manual text input if microphone fails
- 3x loop playback for better learning

### Option 2: Web Interface
```bash
# Open in browser
start index.html
```

**Features:**
